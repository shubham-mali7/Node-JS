NOde JS ------

Node JS ek run time environment hai jo javascript ka code run karta hai v8 engine ki help se 
> Node js is Single threaded

>GLOBAL MODULES 
Global modules are node packages that are installed on your system rather than your project directory. They allow us to use the package as a tool anywhere on the local computer.

> jo module hame import karne padte hai vo non global module hote hai because vo bydefault environment mai nahi hai usko import karna padta hai

> jo module import karneki ki jaroorat nahi hoti qki vo globally present hote hai usse kehte hai global module ex: console 
> fs(fileSystem), Buffer , HTTP  --- Core Modules 
ex fs fileSystem ka ek non global module hai 

> http --> module hai jo node ke andar server ki request or response ko handle karta hai 
> Press ^C at any time to quit.

> Package.json hamare project ke code related details rakhta hai
> Sara ka sara lenadena Package.json npm se he hai (node Package manager) 
> dependensies mai sare ke sare packages manage honge
> We should not delete package.json file as it can destroy our project 
> package.json is the important file and should be handled properly 
> .gitignore to ignore node_module 
> package or module ek he cheej hoti hai bs naam alag hai 

Route
> A route refers to an HTTP method, path, and handler combination. Routes are created and added to the server before it starts listening for requests.

NodeMOn
> Time saving module 
> Nodemon aapke nodejs ke project ko continuosly run karte hai 
> nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
> How to run nodemon : ex ==>  nodemon .\readMongo.js (only once)

nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node. To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script.

>Javascript is the synchronous single-threaded language but with the help of event-loop and promises, JavaScript is used to do asynchronous programming.

>NodeJS is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime environment designed to build scalable network applications.

POSTMAN ----

> POSTMAN sends request from client to server via network, thats why its called POSTMAN 
> Postman is a tool used to test API 
> GET , PUT, POST , DELETE
>module.exports = data;----> example to export anything in nodeJS (use module.exports )
>const data = require('./data');----> example to import anything in nodeJS (use require)

CRUD with File system - Create Read Update Delete  

asynchronous NODE 
> Jo chheje node ki core mahi hai matlab hamne kahise inherit kari hai (c ya c++ se) like (setTimeout()) vo node API vale block mai registor ho jati hai 

> Jab hum C C++ vale libraries se interact karte hai toh unhe bhi API kehte hai--- (2:47--YT)

> API(Application Programming Interface) -- jab 2 programming language ke beech mai koi interface hota hai toh usse hum API kehte hai 

> Express JS is the framework of NOde

> NODE JS apneaap mai ek choti library hai --- (2:57 YT)

> We can use Express in 2 ways --- (3:18 YT) -- Executable function and one individual function 

MIDDLEWARE -----

> bohot baar hame authentications check karni hoti hai user login hai ya nahi hai toh vo hum Middleware ke andar kar sakte hai ya fir hame koi specific country ke andar site block karni hoti hai aise cases mai middleware use karte hai 


MONGODB -----

> MongoDB is NoSQL
> MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas
> Data is stored in a collection
> Collection dont have row and columns 
> Data is stored in form of objects
> MongoDB kee andar tables nahi hote collections hote hai 

2 ways to connect node with mongo (any 1 can be used) ---4:53 ---YT
const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");
const MongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient;

CRUD: ---------

Create/Insert : db.products.insertOne({prdName: "Ravan", category: "Book", Series: "RamChandra", Author: "Anmish"})
Read : db.products.find()
Update: db.products.updateOne({prdName:"IKIGAI"},{$set:{author:"Nick Fury"}})
Delete: db.products.deleteOne({prdName:"J5-Prime"})


-----------------

module.exports = dbConnect; ------ to export any function
const dbConnect = require('./mongodb') ------ to import

> Use of filter in node? -->intv Q
> How to send function as parameter in node ? -->intv Q
> can we delete Node Module? - yes , as we can recover by npm install 
> Right method to add our project on git - By adding node module in .gitignore 
> is node js sync or async ? -- async (it all about category when we talk of threading - nodejs is single threaded but if we talk about sync or async then its async)
> What are status -- 200 ,201, 202, 404 , 500 etc --> understand this 
> What is Buffer? ----> Temporary memory location 
> Whats the help of path module ? It helps to get the path to access your project folder
> static method kya karta hai ? aapke static pages ko load karta hai  
> What is template engines ? ---> Used in making dynamic pages , we have to install them as they are npm packages 
> What are Dynamic pages ? 
> What are Middleware and how to make it ? --> with Middleware we can access the req and resp and can modify them
